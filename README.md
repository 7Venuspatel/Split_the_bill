# Split_the_bill
first of all, i have added all the mandatory platforms such as solution file, class library and unit test platform.
secondly, i have gave them reference in order to fetch the data and use variable and method too.
thirdly, i have created 3 methods for each and saved them into class library.
Moreover, i added all the releted references to solution as well.
However, i have faced many challanges such as name invalid or not available and some of the test cases were failing due to in appropiate logic and amount, at same time my codespace was about to end will stop any time.
To avoid that i have converted all the data form old to new repository by creating a new repository in meantime.
i have fixed them with help of tools and resources provided on moodel.
At the end i wrote all the information regarding the assignment in readme file for information to the me and professor.
i commited the whole process.
