# Split_the_bill
first of all, i have added all the mandatory platforms such as solution file, class library and unit test platform.
secondly, i have gave them reference in order to fetch the data and use variable and method too.
thirdly, i have created 3 methods for each and saved them into class library.
Moreover, i added all the releted references to solution as well.
However, i have faced many challanges such as name invalid or not available and some of the test cases were failing due to in appropiate logic and amount.
i have fixed them with help of tools and resources provided on moodel.
At the end i wrote all the information regarding the assignment in readme file for information to the me and professor.
i commited the whole process.
